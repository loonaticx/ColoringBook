# Toontown's 3D Coloring Book [ALPHA]

**Please note that this project is still under construction!!!**

***Not all features listed below may be present in the repo at the moment!!***

## Info ##
The 3D Artist's Coloring Book is a collection of texture-ready models for 3D artists to practice their texturing skills. Regardless of skill level, anyone can practice and sharpen their texturing skills using these models!


## How does it work? ##
Some of these Toontown models have been *depalettized*, emancipating them from redundant texture sheets. Please note that some of these models may *not* be optimized for game-ready implementation. (At least the models that have been depalettized or repalettized)

## What's inside? ##
The coloring book will provide a range of different models, textures, and references to practice over.

### Tutorial Assignments ###
If you are a beginner at texturing Toontown assets, I strongly recommend going through the tutorial folder and working through the "Easy" assignments in order. If you feel comfortable traversing through the easy assignments, feel free to advance on to the "Medium" assignments, and then lastly the "Advanced" assignments! Note that some "Advanced" assignments derive a bit off texturing itself and go more in depth with other skillsets a texture artist could greatly benefit from.

Each assignment will discuss a different topics and methods used to accomplish a texture. Some assignments may provide additional resources and references you can use to your advantage. Don't feel pressured into doing every single assignment to consider yourself a "texture artist". Do as many as you'd like-- after all, they're here to teach you!

### Retexturing Corner ###
The Retexturing Corner is packed with simple 2D art graphics extracted from Toontown. Optimal if you would like to practice in following the Toontown art style.

### The Wiki ###
