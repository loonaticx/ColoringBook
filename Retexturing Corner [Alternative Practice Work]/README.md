# The Retexturing Corner

Hello there! Welcome to the retexturing corner. Before the release of Spotify, retexturing Toontown assets to give them a higher quality look was in quite some demand.

While Spotify cleared up a great amount of work that was previously planned to tackle -- making Toontown HQ, retexturing is still a great way to get a feel for the Toontown art style.

The trick here is to retexture an asset to look as identical as possible to the original, but with higher quality enchancements and upgrades. Feel free to resize the textures in any way you like - this is aimed to practice your visual skills! Due to the nature of these graphics, there's not really much of a need for me to supply a complimentary 3D model. Majority of these assets would only really go on planes anyway.


Additionally, I'll be providing both the non-HQ version of the graphic along with it's Spotify counterpart. It's up to you whether or not if you want to refer the higher quality Spotify version, or stick to the classic lower quality version for more inspiration opportunities.
