# Assignment # 4: The Four Shovels

Congratulations, student! You have almost completed the first chapter of your journey onto becoming a texture artist.

I am proud to see that your hard work is definitely paying off. You seem to learn something new with every texture you start. Even if you don't finish a texture for whatever reason, you still gain that experience, and that's the important part. I see a lot of potential in you, so I've decided to collaborate with you for this assignment.

There are four different shovel models, all with a completely different UV map. I've gone ahead and textured two of them already, can you finish the last two for me?

In this assignment, I will be explaining the importance of keeping consistency throughout texturing.

## Digging for Consistency!

As mentioned before, everybody has their own unique approach in texturing a model. Because of this, it's common for people to have their own unique style that can be easily identified from others.

However, this can create an issue: If you are working with a group of other texture artists, how do you stay in style such that your work would properly fit with the others into the game? After all, you don't want your work to stick out like a sore thumb, you want it to fit right into the environment!

Typically, the more you practice an art style --> the more you develop a feel for that style --> thus the more consistent you will get with that art style.


***DISCLAIMER:*** No, I didn't actually texture these shovels; Disney did. Though, for now, let's pretend I did, okay?

**Goal:** Texture the models such that they would all compliment one another when grouped together.
