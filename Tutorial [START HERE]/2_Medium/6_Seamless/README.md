# Assignment 6: Seamless, Seamstress.

Alright, alright, I feel like I deserve to give you another break from dealing with 3D models, UV maps, all that razz. Hopefully you've learned a lot of new techniques and tricks in texturing those, though we have another topic to talk about -- Patterns. *Also, just because I said "break" doesn't mean you should take it easy yourself!*

This topic in particular can get pretty challenging for some people when it comes to shading basics & color theory. Bottom line, can you make a 2D texture look 3D from just the texture itself.? There's no model or UV involved for this one - well, just a plane model. That's all.

## What are "Seamless Textures"?

Have you ever seen a texture that abruptly cuts off prematurely or breaks the illusion of a consistent looping texture within the area? Well, unfortunately these kind of textures are EVERYWHERE within Toontown. Some of these are preventable, while others are inevitable from how the area is set up.

*Seamless textures* are designed such that the the patterns repeat vertically and horizontally when they are arranged in a tiled format.

## Seamless Tips & Tricks

If you use Photoshop, you can quickly check whether or not corners are seamless by going to Filter>Other>Offset. Make sure the "Wrap around" option is selected. Additionally, you can create a pattern by going to Edit>Define Pattern... Then, apply a pattern fill layer and mess with the X / Y scales to check if there's any breaks.

Alternatively, you can create a new canvas and place down multiple instances of your texture. Stack them edge-to-edge to determine if there's a seam break.

**Goal:** Create a seamless, repeatable texture for a new Toontown street. It can either be Toon or Cog themed, and/or for a new or already-existing playground.
