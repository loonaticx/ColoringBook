# Assignment 8: More GUI

Let's go back to some more GUI practice. Though, this time I want you to imagine yourself in the following situation:

You are currently working on a project that aims to refactor some key aspect of the game. It may be a rewritten battle system, catalog interface, purchasing gags, boarding groups... Or, instead of refactoring a system, perhaps the project aims to create a new feature instead. As an example, Toontown Rewritten had created a new interface for it's settings page, and Toontown: Corporate Clash had created new GUI for the Restoration Station.

**Goal:** Create a menu for anything related to gameplay. New battle GUI? New Doodle purchase UI? New Gag purchase GUI? The sky's the limit!

Note: This isn't intended to be the final goal for this assignment. Currently acts a placeholder.

Self note: I should probably add some concept art that the student can work off.
