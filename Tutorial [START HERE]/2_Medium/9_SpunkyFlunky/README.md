# Assignment 9 - The Spunky Flunky

In this assignment, I will be expanding your creative freedom on a certain Toontown attribute.

## CTR: Cog Textures Rewritten

So, if you've ever seen what a cog face texture looks like (which you probably should have at this point..), it's quite a... mess. I mean, if you were to make your own cog using the same face geometry... you'd be wrestling way too much into getting the texture to look the way you want it to look. The distortion with the cog head textures immobilize room for creativity.

Well, know what? Screw that stupid distortion. We don't need to deal with it anymore. I've provided ~~several~~ models of cog heads with much more fluid UVs, expanding the amount of potential creative freedom available.

Also, as a gift from me, I have supplied you an old project file of mine from a while back. I had originally planned to "repaint" the Corporate Raider to give him a fresher and cleaner look, but I eventually scrapped it. You can use it however you want if you'd like.

*Note: More head models coming soon.*

---

**Goal:** Either re-texture a currently existing cog head (currently only Flunky and Corp Raider), or make up a new cog head texture from scratch using the pre-existing cog head models!

Oh, and if you're wondering how I was able to get these sane-looking cog head textures, I further explain the process in the Advanced lesson, "Freshly-baked Textures!"
