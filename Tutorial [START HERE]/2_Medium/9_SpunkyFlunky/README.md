# Assignment 8 - The Spunky Flunky

In this assignment, I will be expanding your creative freedom on a certain Toontown attribute.

## CTR: Cog Textures Rewritten

So, if you've ever seen what a cog face texture looks like (which you probably should have at this point..), it's quite a... mess. I mean, if you were to make your own cog using the same face geometry... you'd be wrestling way too much into getting the texture to look the way you want it to look. The distortion with the cog head textures immobilize room for creativity.

Well, know what? Screw that stupid distortion. We don't need to deal with it anymore. I've provided several models of cog heads with much more fluid UVs, expanding the amount of potential creative freedom available.

---

**Goal:** Either re-texture a currently existing cog head, or make up a new one from scratch using the pre-existing cog head models!

So, if you're wondering how I was able to get these sane-looking cog head textures, I further explain the process in the Advanced lesson, "Freshly-baked Textures!"
