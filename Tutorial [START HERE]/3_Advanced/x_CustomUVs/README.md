# Assignment # X: U-V-Independent!

Alright, so this next one *might* cause a small shiver down your spine, but don't panic -- we'll get through this one together!

If you check out the UV map of this model, you might be thinking: *"wow, there's a LOT of... different UV shells... Why am I cursed to texture this model like this!! Ach this will take me ages!!"*

Well, you *could* try to texture the model how the UVs are currently laid out, but it'll unnecessarily consume your time, energy, and motivation.

What can we do about this? Well, besides slapping the 3D modeler or whomever touched the UVs last, let's fix this problem ourselves!

## Creating UV Maps from Scratch

I don't like keeping secrets, so let me explain what I've done:
- I took the Underwater Lifesaver Chair from Spotify
- Cracked my knuckles and sipped some water
- Removed the texture paths from all the materials
- In Maya, I selected all of the geometry, UV>Automatic
- Exported it

**Goal:** Successfully texture the model in any way you like. Optionally, feel free to fix the UV in which the original textures can be properly used again.
