# Assignment # X: Freshly-baked Textures!

In this assignment, it will be optional whether or not if you would like a make a texture for this model. I will provide you with a prefabricated texture.

## Baking Onto Different UV's

Say that a model has a really unbearable UV map you have to texture, but you can't just simply replace the UV map of the model and call it a day. Sometimes there's already other textures that are designed for that UV map, so thus changing the map would break all the other textures.
It's definitely not an impossible task to texture, though working on some bad UVs can cause some heavy frustration *and* a heavy amount of time wasted.

### How it works

Baking a texture on to a different UV map requires two things:
- A model with a UV map - say this is the ugly UV one.
- The same exact model *(with the same exact geometry placement, etc.)* with a different UV map - say that this is a cleaner UV than the ugly one.

Texture baking is the process of transferring texture data from one 3D model to another 3D model.

## Caveats
Since the process of texture baking is automated, there's a considerable chance that there may be some unwanted distortion/artifaction on the result. This can be cleaned up using any image editing tool; I recommend using Photoshop's content aware tool for imperfections.

Goal is currently under work in progress.

~~**Goal:** Go to Challenge #9 - Spunky Flunky and bake a custom cog head texture on to the UVs normally used.~~
