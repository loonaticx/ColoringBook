# Assignment 1 - A Gift to Give

Welcome to your first texturing assignment! This assignment will be fairly simple and straightforward, so feel free to go all out on this one!

We wil first start out with re-texturing the estate presents. There are four present boxes in the model, all wrapped with a bow.

## Kicking off; Where to start?

For the beginning, I will be providing some prefabricated textures of our model to serve as a guiding tool. Though, remember that there will eventually be a point where you must texture with no pre-existing texture.

### What is a UV map?
UV mapping is the process of projecting a 2D image to a 3D model's surface for texture mapping. If you've ever done any of those cut-and-fold crafts, it's very similar to that.

For this assignment, you can either preview your texture changes using the OBJ, FBX, or Maya file (if applicable). In our next assignment, I will be introducing a new Panda3D-Exclusive model to preview texture changes.

**Goal:** Go all out and push your creativitiy to the limits texturing these gift presents! Imagine you're trying to impress someone important to you with your amazing gift present-design skills!
