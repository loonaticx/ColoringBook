# Assignment 2 - Hats, Eggs, and Pandas

What, you've never seen a hat-wearing panda eating eggs before? That's crazy, dude! Well, I guess there's a first time for everything...

So, by now you should be somewhat familiar with 3D object files, such as obj, fbx, blend, mb, and/or ma. These files are, of course, the common standard
3D modelers use to share and work with 3D models. The Panda3D game engine is a *bit* special though; Toontown does not natively use any of these standard model formats. Instead, we use two unique extensions called BAM and EGG files.

In order to open and view egg or bam files, we must to use the *pview* application included in Panda3D. By now if you haven't already installed Panda3D, please do so-- it'll help you a lot in the long term.
