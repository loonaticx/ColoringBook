# Assignment # 4: The Four Shovels

Congratulations, student! You have almost completed the first chapter of your journey onto becoming a texture artist.

This assignment includes four different models to texture, and isn't designed to be a quick-and-easy assignment to breeze through.

In this assignment, I will be explaining the importance of keeping consistency throughout texturing.

## Digging for Consistency!

As mentioned before, everybody has their own unique approach in texturing a model. Because of this, it's common for people to have their own unique style that can be easily identified from others.

However, this can create an issue: If you are working with a group of other texture artists, how do you stay in style such that your work would properly fit with the others into the game? After all, you don't
want your work to stick out like a sore thumb, you want it to fit right into the environment!
