# Assignment # 5: Coffee Table D.I.Y.

Welcome to the medium difficulty! Have you started getting a groove on texturing? ... Well, I have to tell you something. I'm going to need you to break out of that groove - temporarily - for this assignment. Trust me, it's for the better!

In this assignment, I want you to look back in the previous textures you've created from the prior assignments. Now, ask yourself these questions:

- Did I develop a personal method/procedure for texturing those models?
    - Ex: Did I paint over using a paintbrush tool, or did I use the pen tool to do most of the composition?
    
- Were there other approaches that I could've done?

## Different Approaches to Texturing

Everybody has their own personal style and method of texturing. However, there can be situations where your preferred approach of texturing may not be the most feasible choice for another model.

In those scenarios, you need to ensure that you have an alternate route ready for texturing!

For example, if you're like me and primairly use Photoshop as a preferred workspace, try experimenting around with texturing in GIMP, or even Paint Tool SAI.

Or, if you're also like me and love using Photoshop's pen tool for most of the work, try texturing using brush tools and with a tablet instead. 

**Goal:** Texture the coffee table WITHOUT using any programs OR methods/approaches done prior.
