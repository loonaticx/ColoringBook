# Assignment # X: Seamless, Seamstress.

Alright, alright, I feel like I deserve to give you another break from dealing with 3D models, UV maps, all that razz. Hopefully you've learned a lot of new techniques and tricks in texturing those, though we have another topic to talk about -- Patterns.

This topic in particular can get pretty challenging for some people when it comes to shading basics & color theory. Bottom line, can you make a 2D texture look 3D from just the texture itself.? There's no model or UV involved for this one - well, just a plane model. That's all.
