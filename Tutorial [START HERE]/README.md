# The Texturing Tutorial

Welcome, welcome! Please make yourself comfortable young Padawan, as we are about to venture into the world of texture art!

This tutorial was written in mind for people who do not already have prior experience in texturing. If you have ever textured for other games before, then I suggest skipping
several modules that you already have a good understanding of. Though, keep in mind that this series is tailored for practices and approaches to texturing for Toontown.

Before we start, let's get you up to par with the tools of the trade. [Check out this wiki article](https://github.com/loonaticx/ColoringBook/wiki/Software-to-use) in which I go into detail about the different software programs to utilize.
